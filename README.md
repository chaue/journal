# Journal using C++ (PIC10C Project)

__Implementation__
* going to start with a simple console project (can implement GUI using QT in future)
* originally wanted to connect this project with a SQL database, but attempting to use the sqlapi++ libraries proved to be too complicated 
* will instead store information in files(which will be located in the project directory), future improvements can be made to improve security
